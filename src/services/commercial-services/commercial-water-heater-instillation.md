serviceFaqs:
  - question: How long do water heaters last?
    answer: Our water heaters are built with quality materials making them last
      longer than most. Although the life of the heater is dependent on water
      quality and usage, we find that a properly sized water heater that follows
      proper maintenance can last at least 10 years and much longer in many
      cases.
  - question: Why is there water underneath my water heater?
    answer: If you find water under your water heater, check to see if pressure
      relief valve is open. If it is not open, assess the base of the tank. If
      you notice that there is rust at the base of your heater, it is possible
      that the thank has rusted through.
  - question: Why does it take so long to get hot water?
    answer: There are a many factors that contribute to why it may take some time
      for hot water to reach you. The distance from the heater to the faucet,
      the size of the heater, the age of the heater, and the amount of hot water
      being used elsewhere all can contribute. If your heater is more than 6
      years old and is taking longer than usual to produce hot water, this may
      be a sign that your water heater is failing.
