title: Ejector Pumps
slug: /ejector-pumps
snippet: Ejector pumps lift the waste water from lower levels to the height of
  the gravity fed sewer system.
details: Your ejector pump handles the waste water the occures below your sewer,
  for instance if you have a basment kitchen,bathroom, or laudnry room. The
  waste water from these go to the ejector pump where it is ground up and
  ejected to your main sewer. Your ejector pump also handles water from floor
  drains in your basmen. Having a strong ejecctor pump is important to prevent
  sewer water from backing up into and flooding your basment. Our pumps are the
  best we could find, offering acceptional build quilty along with strong motors
  and blades to handle even thehardest conditions and oftan usage without worry.

      answer: The best we could find! All pumps come with a minimum of 3 years, with
        some pumps offering much longer warranties. These warranties are truly
        hassle-free meaning if something happens to your pump you call us, we
        pull it out and replace it directly. That’s it, we handle the rest, so
        you don’t have to even call the manufacture.  As good as this warranty
        is, we rarely see it used do to the quality of these pumps.
      question: How is the warranty on these pumps?

      question: I don't have a basement bathroom or kitchen, do I still have an
        ejector pump?
      answer: Yes, you will still have floor drains in your basment. And if you have a
        furnace in your basment its condincation line will discharge to the
        floor drain. Water generated inside the home can not go to a sump pump
        and must be directed to an ejector pump attached to the sewage system.
