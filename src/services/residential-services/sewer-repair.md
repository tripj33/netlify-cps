  - question: Why would I want a cleanout added during a repair?
    answer: The addition of a cleanout during a repair gives access to your sewer on
      the exterior of your home for if your sewer needs to be cleaned in the
      future. The sewer maintenance can be completed from outside of you home in
      the future.
  - question: Why do sewers break?
    answer: Sewers can break from many different reasons. The most common reasons we
      see are poor backfilling around the sewer and the earth below settles
      creating a gap and the weight of the earth above forces the sewer down.
      Sewers can also break from roots growth forcing their way in between
      fittings and expanding breaking the pipe. Sewers can also become brittle
      with old age.
  - question: How long does a typical sewer repair take?
    answer: Typically, we find we are able to make the repair in a day.
