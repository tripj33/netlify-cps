serviceFaqs:
  - question: Why is my faucet handle leaking?
    answer: A leaking faucet can be caused by something as simple as a loose packing
      nut. It also also may be the result of a damaged O-ring that needs to be
      replaced.
  - question: Why is my faucet sputtering water?
    answer: One of the most common causes of sputtering water from a faucet is an
      obstructed aerator. If debris within the plumbing system accumulates on
      your faucets aerator, it can cause an inconsistent flow of water, leading
      to sputtering.
  - question: What is causing my faucet to leak?
    answer: A faucet can leak for a number of different reasons? A failed washer or
      gasket on your faucet may likely be the reason for the leak.
