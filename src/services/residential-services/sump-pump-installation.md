      Our company prides itself on only supplying quality materials by trusted brands! Our sump pumps are no exception to this philosophy. We primarily offer Zoller brand sump pumps in all sizes from 1/3 HP, 1/2 HP, and beyond. Zoller offers pumps with some of the highest and output capacities on the market. These pump's motors can stay cool and functional under the hardest conditions due to their encased oil system within the pump. The motor is controlled by a mechanical float directly attached, meaning no more failures and replacements of floats. All of these features are wrapped within a cast iron pump housing making the pump strong and durable. 

  Your sump pump is responsible for keeping your home dry and safe from flooding, you only deserve the best protection, and we are here to install it.

serviceFaqs:
  - question: What is the difference between a sump pump and an ejector pump?
    answer: This is a common question asked by many people. The purpose of the sump
      pump is to remove water from around the exterior of your home to prevent
      water seeping into your basement. While an ejector pump is responsible for
      removing the waste from your homes drainage system and moving it into a
      sewer.
  - question: Why do you use Zoller Pumps?
    answer: At Chicagoland Plumbing, we believe in utilizing the highest quality
      materials to get the job done right. We have found that Zoeller pumps are
      some of the best that many can by. They have many features that set them
      apart from other pumps such as the cast iron housing and oil-cooled
      components. Both of which help to extend the life of the pump.

      answer: A sump pump handles ground water that collects around your foundation
        and ejects it out of your home to prevent it from seeping in. An ejector
        pump handles wastewater that is below the height of your sewer such as,
        basement floor drains, basement bathrooms, or drains for any appliances
        in your basement.

      question: How long do your pumps usually last?
      answer: The longevity of the pump’s life will greatly depend on its usage, but
        in comparison to other brand even in the hardest conditions we find our
        pumps to outlast the competitors by a long shot. For most of our sump
        pump installation our customers will see their pump last them between
        10-15 years without issue.

      question: How is the warranty on these pumps?
      answer: The best we could find! All pumps come with a minimum of 3 years, with
        some pumps offering much longer warranties. These warranties are truly
        hassle-free meaning if something happens to your pump you call us, we
        pull it out and replace it directly. That’s it, we handle the rest, so
        you don’t have to even call the manufacture.  As good as this warranty
        is, we rarely see it used do to the quality of these pumps.
