snippet: "Drain cleaning is an excellent way to make sure your home plumbing
  system stays running properly. "
details: "Drain cleaning also referred to as rodding or snaking a drain, is the
  term for sending a metal cable through the drain pipes within your home to
  clean any debris or build up that are causing or may cause a backup. Drain
  cleaning can help slow draining showers, bathtubs, kitchen sinks and anywhere
  else in your home water struggles to make its way down the drain quickly. Call

serviceFaqs:
  - question: "Why should I have my drain routinly cleaned or as it starts to slow? "
    answer: Routine drain cleaning and maintenance can be completed much easier and
      quicker than waiting until a full blockage occurs. This means taking less
      time out of your day and saving you money. Sewer backups can cause damage
      to the plumbing system and backflow wastewater into the home causing
      damage to property.
  - question: One of my drains constantly has issues and backs up, how can I stop this?
    answer: "If you are having frequent recurring issues with a drain line this is a
      sign that there is another issue going on. Our professional plumbers can
      determine the cause of the main issue your drain is having and provide a
      solution to stop the recurring backups. "
  - question: Can't I just use drain cleaning products from the store?
    answer: We strongly recommend against using drain cleaning products in your slow
      or obstructed drains. These chemicals can damage your drainage system
      leading to costly repairs.
