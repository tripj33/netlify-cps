serviceFaqs:
  - question: What should I do if my sink is draining slowly?
    answer: It is best to have your drain cleaned when you notice it starting to
      slow. If the sink is only draining slowly, it indicates that it is a
      partial obstruction. These obstructions are much easier to clear than
      complete obstruction.
  - question: Why is water coming up from my bathtub drain?
    answer: This is almost certainly the sign of an obstruction within your home
      drainage system. It is important to have the obstruction cleared quickly
      in order to prevent water from continuing to rise into your bathtub.
  - question: Can I use drain cleaning products for a clogged drain?
    answer: While drain cleaners are advertised as a cheap solution to an
      obstruction, they come with a hidden cost. Drain cleaners damage the seals
      of your drainage system and can lead to costly repairs.
