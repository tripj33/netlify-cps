serviceFaqs:
  - question: Do battery backup pumps only work during a power outage?
    answer: No, our battery backup pumps will kick on if your primary pump ever
      stops working. If this happens, you will also be alarmed by the system
      your primary pump has failed. Our battery backup systems will also work
      alongside our primary pumps in the event of heavy rainfall both pumps can
      work together to ejector water as fast as it comes in.
  - question: What kind of maintenance do I have to do with a battery backup system?
    answer: " The systems we install are truly maintenance-free! Our systems are
      installed with a gel battery similar to what is in your car, requiring no
      maintenance on your part. The computer system will monitor the battery
      life and alarm you if it is getting close to needing replacement. The
      computer will also monitor if there is a failure of your primary pump or
      an issue with your backup pump."
  - question: Do I need a battery backup system if my basement is unfinished?
    answer: Even if your basement is not considered "finished", many homes still
      have expensive appliances such as furnaces and water heaters that can be
      damaged by water. This is not to mention water damage to belongings and
      the possibility of mold.
