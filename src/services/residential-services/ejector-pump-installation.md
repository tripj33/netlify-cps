  - question: What is the difference between a sump pump and an ejector pump?

      sump pump will remove the water from around your home to keep your
      basement dry.

      answer: The best we could find! All pumps come with a minimum of 3 years, with
        some pumps offering much longer warranties. These warranties are truly
        hassle-free meaning if something happens to your pump you call us, we
        pull it out and replace it directly. That’s it, we handle the rest, so
        you don’t have to even call the manufacture.  As good as this warranty
        is, we rarely see it used do to the quality of these pumps.
      question: How is the warranty on these pumps?
  - faqs:
      question: I don't have a basement bathroom or kitchen, do I still have an
        ejector pump?
      answer: Yes, you will still have floor drains in your basment. And if you have a
        furnace in your basment its condincation line will discharge to the
        floor drain. Water generated inside the home can not go to a sump pump
        and must be directed to an ejector pump attached to the sewage system.
